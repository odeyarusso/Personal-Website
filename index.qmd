Throughout my academic journey, I have excelled in relevant coursework, including Data Analysis and Regression, Design and Analysis of Experiments, Statistical Models and Data Mining, Computational Statistics, Computation and Optimization for Statistics, Monte Carlo Methods, Statistical Consulting, and Geo-statistics, and have received recognition for my commitment to excellence (Dean's Honor List). Eager to leverage my skills, I am actively seeking entry-level data analyst positions where I can contribute my analytical abilities and continue to grow in the field.\
